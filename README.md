## Overview

Build tools (Phing, Yeoman, Grunt, etc.) are all the rage, so let's use them with Drupal! 

This session explores how to build a Drupal site (and some other goodies) using Grunt, a Javascript task runner.

We'll discuss:

- How to setup your repository to work with Grunt
- Grunt syntax
- What type of tasks can be automated with Grunt
- What other tools can be added to your repository
